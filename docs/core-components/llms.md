# ðŸ§  LLMs

## What is LLMs aka Large Language Models?

An LLM, or Large Language Model, is a fundamental element of BeyondLLM. It is used in the generate function to generate a response. We support a variety of models including `ChatOpenAI`, `Gemini`, `HuggingFaceHub Models`, `AzureChatOpenAI` and `Ollama` wrapper.

### GeminiModel

Gemini is the default model used in BeyondLLM. This model includes the Gemini family models from Google.

_Notes: Currently we only support **gemini-pro** and **gemini-1.0-pro. Also no need to install Google Generative AI, because this is a default model.**_&#x20;

**Parameters**

* **Google API Key** : Key used to authenticate and access the Gemini API. Get API key from here: [https://ai.google.dev/](https://ai.google.dev/)
* **Model Name :** Defines the Gemini chat model to be used in eg: _**gemini-pro**_

**Code snippet**

```python
from beyondllm.llms import GeminiModel

llm = GeminiModel(model_name="gemini-pro",google_api_key = "<your_api_key>")
```

Import the GeminiModel from the llms and configure it according to your needs and start using it.

### GPT-4o Multimodal Model

This LLM, GPT4OpenAIModel, harnesses the power of OpenAI's GPT-4o model with vision capabilities, enabling interactions that go beyond simple text. It seamlessly handles image, audio, and video inputs alongside text prompts, opening up a realm of multimodal possibilities within your BeyondLLM applications.

In order to harness the multi-modal capabilities of this model, make sure to install the below libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python moviepy
```

**Parameters:**

* **api\_key** (required): Your OpenAI API key. You can find this key on your OpenAI account page.
* **model** (optional): Specifies the GPT-4 model to use. The default is "gpt-4o," which is GPT-4 with vision capabilities.
* **model\_kwargs** (optional): A dictionary of additional keyword arguments to pass to the OpenAI API call, such as max\_tokens (to control response length) or temperature (to influence the randomness of the output).
* **media\_paths** (optional): The path or a list of paths to your multimedia files (images, audio, or video). You can pass either a single string representing a file path or a list of strings for multiple files. Supported formats include:
  * **Images:** JPG, PNG
  * **Audio:** MP3, WAV
  * **Video:** MP4, AVI, WEBM

**Code Snippet:**

```python
from beyondllm.llms import GPT4OpenAIModel

# Initialize the GPT4OpenAIModel with your API key
llm = GPT4OpenAIModel(api_key="your_openai_api_key")
```

**Example Usages:**

**1. Using a Single Image:**

```python
image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
response = llm.predict("What can you tell me about this image?", media_paths=image_path)
print(response)
```

**2. Using Multiple Media Files:**

```python
media_paths = ["path/to/image.png", "path/to/audio.mp3", "path/to/video.mp4"]
response = llm.predict("Summarize the content of these files", media_paths=media_paths)
print(response)
```

**NOTE**: Whisper will be used for Audio to Text transcription

BeyondLLM allows you to easily incorporate GPT-4's multimodal abilities into your projects without having to manage the complexities of media encoding and transcription

### ChatOpenAIModel

ChatOpenAI is a chat model provided by OpenAI which is trained on instructions dataset in a large corpus.&#x20;

**Installation**

In order to use ChatOpenAIModel, we first need to install it:

```bash
pip install openai
```

**Parameters**

* **OpenAI API Key**: Key used to authenticate and access the `OpenAI API`. Get your API key from here: [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)
* **Model Name :** Defines the OpenAI chat model to be used in eg: `GPT3.5` and `GPT4` series.
* **Max Tokens :** The output sequence length response from the model.
* **Temperature** : It can be used to control the randomness or creativity in responses.

**Code snippet**

```python
from beyondllm.llms import ChatOpenAIModel

llm = ChatOpenAIModel(model="gpt-3.5-turbo",api_key = "",model_kwargs = {"max_tokens":512,"temperature":0.1})
```

Import the ChatOpenAIModel from the llms and configure it according to your needs and start using it

### HuggingFaceHubModel&#x20;

The Hugging Face Hub is a platform with over 350k models, 75k datasets, and 150k demo apps (Spaces), all open source and publicly available, in an online platform where people can easily collaborate and build ML together.

**Installation**

In order to use HuggingFaceModel, we first need to install it:

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
```

**Parameters**

* **Token :** HuggingFace Access Token to run the model on Inference API. You can get your Access token from here: [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
* **Model :** Model name from the HuggingFace Hub â€“ defaults to `zephyr-7b-beta`.

**Code snippet**

<pre class="language-python"><code class="lang-python"><strong>from beyondllm.llms import HuggingFaceHubModel
</strong>
llm = HuggingFaceHubModel(model="huggingfaceh4/zephyr-7b-alpha",token="&#x3C;replace_with_your_token>",model_kwargs={"max_new_tokens":512,"temperature":0.1})
</code></pre>

Specify the model name from the HuggingFaceHub and add your token and start using it.

### Ollama&#x20;

Ollama lets you run models locally and use them in your application.

In order to get started with Ollama, we first need to download it, and pull the model based on our need.  Download Ollama: [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)
